30: {text: "As the new year approaches I wonder what lie ahead. Here, outside my window
    the incessant sound of gentrification and progress while I try to find the intersection
    of code and spirit. Where is the place of programming in the life of an urban
    shaman? Is there a path to enlightenment to be found on the command line. \n\nSo----what
    do I do first. Where does one begin such a process? I guess I’d want to start
    with looking to see what was available. Somewhere in the identification of what
    resources are present and in what quantities I might gleen some idea of where
    I should or could look. Ruby on Rails was where I began. I had heard that from
    a number of YouTube resources *ADDLINKS that Ruby was a very easy language to
    learn and that Ruby on Rails was fast and efficient in the process of designing
    and developing web applications.\n\nSo, perhaps some background is in order. How
    did I get into technology? My father has always been very pragmatic and he wanted
    to teach me how to make good, sound choices when spending money, in particular..his.
    I had just graduated from Elementary school and the year following my commencement
    the school introduced computers to their ciricculum. I missed it but that didn’t
    dim my light. \n\nMy desire for unerstanding math was challenged by my teachers
    ability to translate math into relevant language. They couldn’t put numbers into
    strings so to speak. that may not make sense yet but that’s the whole point isn’t
    it. Understanding evolves if we continue to follow the stream..the way, get out
    of your own WAY. Perhaps the way to do this is to just get ouf of \nWednesday,

    so I added a RedNotebook Journal to this folder so I can see how I might incorporate
    this into my design flow.\n\nThere are  a lot of features in RedNotebook that
    could be quite handy in the creation of a #ROR application\n\nMath --- Wednesday,
    12/30/2015 08:18:16 AM - It was hard for me to understand math at times, not because
    I couldn't comprehend the concepts and theorems it was a lack of discipline. I
    had such an easy comprehension of language that I became complacent with my math
    skills and didn't create enough routine. Math is a language and it has to be practiced
    like any other language if you're going to understand it. #math #stem #elementaryschoolbasics
    #mathiseverything It's not impossible to think that we're unable to find better
    ways to communicate about math. I think I want to look into this common core math
    a bit more and see just how they are guiding children to find logical solutions
    to this world. \n\nMath was always something that required practice. Memorization
    was mistaken as the goal, say trying to remember a #multiplication table or a
    method. It was easier, for me at least, to remember how to do find solutions and
    what the implications would be. To think of it in #unix #unixprogramphilosophy
    terms of how you structure your applications, **always design with the idea that
    your output will be another applications input**.\n\n#personalthought I have to
    decide how committed I am to school. A #CS degree path would mean a lot of #highlevelmath
    classes that I may not be prepared for. I also want to be true to the #artistinme
    and follow my hearts desire of the creation of art. \n\n"}
